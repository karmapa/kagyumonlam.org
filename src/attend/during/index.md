# What to Wear During the Monlam

All lay practitioners are encouraged to receive the Mahayana Sojong vows each day during the Monlam this coming year. All lay practitioners who receive the Mahayana Sojong vows, both men and women, should dress completely in white during this time, as a sign of purification. Clothing should completely cover the lower part of your body and your legs. 

Bring a pair of shoes/sandals that are easy to slide off because you will be asked to remove your shoes on many occasions. We recommend buying cheap shoes or sandals. You can buy flip-flops in Bodhgaya for ~100 Rupees. 

# How to Behave

Many thousands of people from all cultures will attend this year's Kagyu Monlam. You should come prepared to expect all of the challenges that accompany a crowded environment. Please observe the following behaviors to preserve order and mutual respect during the event: 

   * Practice patience while waiting in queues: Do not push your way to the front. 
   * Please, no photography or recording at any time! The Monlam organization will share professionally produced photos and videos via social media. 
   * Observe respectful [shrine room etiquette](http://www.kagyu.org/ktd/monastery/dharma_etiquette.php) and work not to disturb others around you. If disturbed, work to minimize further disturbance.  
      * When in the presence of a Rinpoche, defer to him in every way possible. Stand when he enters a room--especially the shrine room.
      * Do not leave Dharma books and puja materials on the floor or step over them. 
      * Do not point your feet toward the throne or any shrine.
      * During teachings, do not speak, get up, or walk around unless absolutely necessary.
      * Never play amplified sound during a teaching. If using a device to listen to the teachings, always use headphones so you don't disturb your neighbors.
      * Turn off or set any portable devices, digital watches, etc. to "Silent" mode.
