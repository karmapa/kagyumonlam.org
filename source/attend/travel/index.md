# <a name="4"></a>Tips for Travel by Train 

* Train tickets for most lines are sold in several different categories: A/C First Class, A/C Sleeper in two- or three-tier, A/C Chair Car, 2nd Class (non A/C) in two- or three-tier. Because these categories can be confusing, it is best to consult a travel agent or tourist service center before purchasing one.
* Timetables (Trains at a Glance) can be hard to read or understand. It's therefore easier to buy a train ticket through a travel agent or tourist service center.
* Safety around train stations. Areas surrounding railway stations, and crowded areas in general, are notoriously high risk areas full of pickpockets and thieves. Plan ahead to avoid both pushing or being pushed through a crowded area and searching through your bags for tickets or visas or cash. Never open a bag of any kind in public. Keep whatever you need handy, like a small amount of cash and your ticket, in a secure inside pocket.
* Do not expose any valuables or cash at any time. Whenever possible use the waiting room for First Class and A/C Sleeper passengers. Pay special attention when getting in and out of trains or any other transport. Bodhgaya is located in Bihar State which is especially infamous for dacoits (bandits) and crime.
* Security on trains. First Class A/C compartments are the only place that are normally quite safe. None of the others are. Do not leave anything of value close to open train windows, doors and walkways. Never leave anything on your seat if you vacate it even for a moment to use a toilet or stretch your legs. Tightly lock up and chain your luggage to a seat for security if you plan to sleep. Do not accept food or drink from anyone including casual acquaintances on trains. Have your own snacks with you, somewhere easy to reach without exposing your valuables, visa or cash.

# <a name="6"></a>Health

Make sure that your vaccinations are up-to-date, especially for Hepatitis. Bring an adequate supply of prescription medicines, over the counter medications such as ibuprofen and nutrient supplements if you use them. Have your doctor recommend a basic travel medical kit. 

Bring sunscreen, moisturizer, lip balm, and a good quality hand sanitizer, Pepto-Bismol tablets, sun hat, and oral rehydration sachets. You will be able to buy purified water for drinking, cleaning your teeth etc. A thermos bottle and a heating coil (with the proper adaptor) can be very handy, especially if you bring packets of instant soup, coffee, or tea bags. The bottle and coil allow you to refresh in your hotel room. 

To protect your health and ensure a positive experience, please observe these guidelines as well: 

* Food poisoning can ruin your entire trip. Pay close attention to food safety, eat freshly cooked food, refrain from eating salads, raw food, and cold dishes unless you know for sure they are properly prepared. Bottled water is not always safe in India. Always bring a bottle of drinking water with you is the best. If you buy drinking water, make sure that the lid is sealed in-tact as often water bottles are refilled with contaminated water. 

* Diarrhea saps energy, don't ignore it. Rehydrate your body after such incidents with electrolyte drinks (available in tablets and as powder).

* If you get a cold or flu, treat it with remedies that work for you. Try not to pass it on to others by wearing a mask and/or avoiding close contact. Flu bugs can go around easily and quickly in a big gathering.

* Clean your hands frequently with hand sanitizer or wipes.

* Air pollution is common in most Indian towns and cities. Use masks in congested areas.

# <a name="7"></a>Safety

* In tourist areas, thieves and pickpockets mix in with the crowd of beggars. Keep your bags close to your body at all times. Avoid crowds and be extra careful when in the midst of crowds.

* Before entering a taxi or rickshaw, negotiate and agree on a price, location of drop-off and pick-up, etc., to avoid conflicts later on. Be sure that the driver understands where you want to go and do not ride if you have any concerns. 

* Bargaining is a fact of life when shopping in India. If you have no intention to buy, do NOT enter into a serious bargaining for fun, especially in Bodhgaya.

* Take measures against theft. Do not assume hotel rooms are safe. Inquire if the hotel can keep your passport, traveler's checks and valuables safely and if it guarantees secure storage. Make copies of your passport and Indian visa and a list of travelers' check numbers, Leave one set with friends or keep it separate from the originals. Lock your hotel room securely whenever you leave, put on the extra security chain before you go to sleep.

# <a name="8"></a>Weather and what to bring 

The Kagyu Monlam Chenmo usually takes place during winter months when the weather is pleasantly dry, warm, and sunny. During the day, the temperature is usually somewhere between 20-30ºC (68 to 86ºF), but early mornings and evenings it can drop as low as 4 or 5 ºC (40ºF). Bring layers of clothing to wear and a pair of new slippers or thick socks to wear at the Temple.

Sleeping bags are recommended for those choosing a budget or middle price hotel, or a guest house. 

You must have an FM radio with earphones to get a translation of the talks, rituals and other events in your language. Do not bring a device without earphones as you will disturb everyone around you.

This is a sacred occasion attended by many monks and nuns, so plan to observe a dress code which maintains modesty. Loose fitting clothes work best for comfort and decency.

Bring a pair of shoes/sandals that are easy to slide off because you will be asked to remove your shoes on many occasions. Slippers with a plastic sole are good to have, as the ground gets wet in the early morning. Also please bring a shoe bag to carry your shoes with you, both at the Monlam Pavilion and the Mahabodhi Stupa.

# <a name="9"></a>Local Customs

* "Namaste" is an all-purpose greeting. It can be used in place of "Good morning," "Good afternoon," "Good evening," "Welcome," "How are you?" and so on.
* When responding to a question, Indians tend to shake their heads from side to side. This can mean "OK," "No problem," or "Yes."
* In most areas, an Indian house doesn't have a street address, nor a sign. When giving directions, locals rely on land marks such as bridges, temples, and markets. It's a good way to navigate the landscape.
* The pace of life in India is relatively slow. Allow extra time and practice patience. 
* Do not touch the heads of children, because it is considered the sacred part of a person. 
* Indian etiquette dictates that one uses the right hand to eat, the left is used to handle unclean matter and is thus perceived as unclean. Therefore, avoid touching others with your left hand or giving things to others with your left hand.
* Typical business hours are Monday through Friday 9:00&ndash;13:00, 14:00&ndash;17:30. Government agencies and many large-sized business organizations are closed on Saturdays and Sundays.
* Cows are considered sacred and let free to roam in India. Hurting cows in any way is a serious offense.
* Before entering a religious place, remove your shoes. Put them on shelves or in the designated area if available. Otherwise, carry them with you in a plastic bag or your backpack.

# <a name="10"></a>Other Useful Tips:

* India has only one time zone and does not adopt daylight savings time. It is 13 hours and 30 minutes ahead of the Pacific Time of North America during non-DST period, or 12 hours 30 minutes during DST period. It is 2 hours and 30 minutes behind Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China.
* Electricity is 220-240 volts AC, and unstable in most areas. India uses 2- or 3-round-pin plugs but socket sizes vary and may not be always available at hotels. You may want to bring a universal adaptor and/or transformers.
* Reception of cell/mobile phones is not stable, but there are many STD/ISD phone booths to make international calls at low rates. 
* Mobile networks do not always have good data connectivity, and even hotel wifi can be spotty. Do not count on being able to access the internet from your phone or smart device. Please print and securely store any important documents (such as travel documents, insurance and medical information, copies of your passport, etc.)
