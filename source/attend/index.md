# Important Note about Indian Currency
Please take note that, as of November 8, 2016, the government of India has [banned](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/world/asia/india-rupee-ban-narendra-modi.html) all 500INR and 1000INR notes. This has greatly constrained the amount of currency available. ATMs can dispense a maximum of 2,000INR per day, and ATM lines are quite long. Sometimes you can wait in line only to have that ATM run out of money. 

While the situation is expected to improve by the time of the Monlam, all visitors are highly encouraged to obtain Indian Rupees **before** you reach Bodhgaya as cash supplies here are quite limited. **Do not accept any 500INR or 1,000INR notes as these are not accepted by any vendors and are no longer legal tender.**
